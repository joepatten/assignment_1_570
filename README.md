# Assignment 1
Joe Patten

This assignment was done 100\% all by myself. 
In order to run the code for assignment 1, you can either run the run_code.sh shell script, or run `python ./Assignment_1.py` in your shell.
The data is downloaded, unzipped, and converted to numpy arrays.
5.2 runs a bit slower (and is a part of code I wish to optimize in the future). It does run though (it just takes forever to do so). 
If you want to test out 5.2 code, then I would suggest changing the variables `iterations_a`, and `iterations_b_d` to be lower numbers.

Things to do:
- Optimize MC algorithms (use sparse matrices?)
